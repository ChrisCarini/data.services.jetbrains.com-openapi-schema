# OpenAPI Schema for data.services.jetbrains.com

A community-driven OpenAPI definition for data.services.jetbrains.com

I was in need of an OpenAPI schema for the following APIs provided by `data.services.jetbrains.com`:

- https://data.services.jetbrains.com/products
- https://data.services.jetbrains.com/products/releases

The `openapi.yaml` file in this repository is a community-driven OpenAPI definition for the above APIs (or, any other APIs that are provided by `data.services.jetbrains.com`).

## Background

I used ["ActionsGPT" by ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-TYEliDU6A-actionsgpt) to draft the original OpenAPI schema, and then manually refined it. It's a work in progress, and I'm looking for community contributions to improve and expand the schema. Ideally, JetBrains will provide an official OpenAPI schema for these APIs, but until then, this community-driven schema can be used.
